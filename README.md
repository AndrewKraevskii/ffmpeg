# FFmpeg Packaged for Zig

This is a fork of [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), packaged for Zig. Unnecessary
files have been deleted, and the build system has been replaced with
`build.zig`. The `upstream` branch of this repository contains a mirror of the
official ffmpeg source tree. When an upstream release is tagged, the changes are
merged from `upstream` into this `main` branch.

## Update Process

These are the instructions to update this package when a new FFmpeg version is
released upstream.

1. Merge the new tag into main and resolve all conflicts by replacing the
   conflicting files with the files from upstream.
2. `find libavcodec/ libavdevice/ libavfilter/ libavformat libavutil/ libswscale/ libswresample/ -type f -name "*.asm" -o -name "*.c" -o -name "*.S"`
   * Edit to omit files ending in `_template.c`
   * Sort the list
   * Update the `all_sources` list in `build.zig`.
3. Inspect the git diff to keep some of the source files commented out like
   they were before. Some handy filtering rules apply:
   * `/L` prefix means Linux-only
   * `/W` prefix means Windows-only
4. Run `./configure --disable-doc --disable-htmlpages --disable-manpages --disable-podpages --disable-txtpages --disable-programs --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libvorbis`
   against upstream and diff the generated `config.h` file to the one generated
   by this build script. Apply appropriate changes to `build.zig`.
5. Update these files which are generated by the upstream configure script:
   * `config_components.h`
   * `libavfilter/filter_list.c`
   * `libavcodec/codec_list.c`
   * `libavcodec/parser_list.c`
   * `libavcodec/bsf_list.c`
   * `libavformat/demuxer_list.c`
   * `libavformat/muxer_list.c`
   * `libavdevice/indev_list.c`
   * `libavdevice/outdev_list.c`
   * `libavformat/protocol_list.c`
